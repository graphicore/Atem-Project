<h1>Developer Mindset</h1>

<p>An attempt to get you into a good mood for development in the Atem-Project.</p>

<p><em>Never finished. Additions welcome.</em></p>

<h2>Be Autonomous</h2>

<p>Learn how things are done in Atem by reading code and documentatin and
by understanding it for yourself. If you have trouble understanding the
JavaScript of Atem, go to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>
(nowhere else) and learn the syntax and API. <em>Don&#39;t let us find the
documentation for you.</em> It doubles the time wasted for the task and you
learn less.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s no documentation and you have a hard time understanding something,
try to <strong>formulate a most informed question.</strong> If that did not help you
already we&#39;ll be glad answering you.</p>

<p>If you just had a fundamental breakthrough in understanding something in
Atem, <strong>be a hero and write a short article</strong> to share in the
<a href="index.html">Concepts</a> or
<a href="../Manuals/index.html">Manuals</a> section.</p>

<h2>Look at Atem-Project in its entirety</h2>

<p>Always consider the whole Atem-Project, not just your specific problem at
hand. Many solutions may be better/leaner if applied in a lower level of
the project. Before you start to hack a fix around some bad behavior of a
dependency, <strong>consider fixing the dependency.</strong></p>

<p>This is important, because of the subproject-structure of Atem it is likely
that you think fixing the hindrance is <q>to much effort</q> or whatever. But
in fact it will in the most cases <strong>improve the project and make it more
complete.</strong> Also, you will learn more about the project structure and
eventually start taking part in forming the lower level structures of the
project.</p>

<p>A good starting point to fix lower level code could be to make a
clean sub-class of the module in question, within your project, and implement
the changes needed there (or do monkey-patching if there&#39;s no better way).
That way, discussing the upstreaming of the changes will be easy and
straight forward and you can keep on going without a pull request, maybe
file an issue and point to the changes needed.</p>

<p>For the project, <strong>the most valuable thing you can give is a pull request.</strong>
But this kind of contribution can slow things down; because there is peer
review involved: people reading the code, discussions, requests for changes
etc. If, for whatever reason you lack the time for a proper pull request
process, it is OK to do it as described above. Important is that you don&#39;t
take the foundation you build upon as given and work around weaknesses,
instead, <strong>improve the foundation</strong>.</p>

<h2>Write code for other people to read</h2>

<p>When writing code try to be short and precise but not cryptic. The most
important function of your code is to be read by other developers, <strong>write
code as if you want to explain something to a human being.</strong></p>

<h2>Break Stuff</h2>

<p>To make things better you got to break things. <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-be-afraid-to-break-stuff/">Don&#39;t be afraid to break stuff</a>,
it&#39;s an opportunity for you to learn and it&#39;s probably the right way to
achieve your goal.</p>

<p>We use the concept of <q>private</q> properties/functions/methods—marked with
an <code>_</code> underscore as the prefix of a name—<em>that&#39;s <strong>invaluable</strong> when refactoring
code.</em> Be reckless when changing private APIs, be careful when changing public
APIs. Use <code>grep</code>, consider all users of a public APIs, see how the public APIs
are used. <strong>By default, add private APIs</strong>, only add public APIs when they are
really needed in the very moment. <em>Don&#39;t presumably add new public APIs,</em>
unless it&#39;s really core to how your module is to be used.</p>

<p>After breaking things you should still try to make a Pull Request that does
not break things <q>too much</q>, or at least inform us about things you broke
in your PR. The point is that <strong>your result will be better if you did break
stuff in the process.</strong></p>
