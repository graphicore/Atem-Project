<h1>Vision</h1>

<p>This is where we are and where we are going. Have a look at our
<a href="history.md.html">history</a> to see where
we are coming from. Take this as <strong>the bigger picture</strong>. We will have detailed
roadmap documents published for shorter term goals.</p>

<h2>Where We Are</h2>

<p>We have three Applications to demo the state of the technology.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://metapolator.com" target="_blank">Metapolator</a> a next generation font-family
authoring tool. It has a great vision and is in a minimal viable product state.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://metapolator.com/developer-tool/" target="_blank">MOM-Developer-Tool</a>
which reveals a lot of the inner workings of Metapolator and has the potential to grow into
our generic platform base.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/graphicore/Bauhaus-Emblem-Font" target="_blank">Bauhaus-Emblem-Font</a> (not online yet)
Which serves three purposes:

<ol>
<li>An <em>editor for type on a circle</em> as seen on the Bauhaus-Emblem of Oskar Schlemmer,</li>
<li>a <em>tech-demo for Atem</em> and</li>
<li>an <em>initiation and learning tool for CPS</em>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<p>Our code-base is in a good shape for the moment. It&#39;s split up into modules
with clearly defined dependencies. We have solved some harder problems that
occur when JavaScript is used in different environments than just the browsers,
like node.js command-lines e.g. <code>Atem-IO</code>.</p>

<p>In presentations or in face-to-face dialogues, we get generally good to
positively excited feedback when we show what we have.</p>

<h2>Where we ultimately end up</h2>

<p>The <em>Developer-Tool</em> type of applications will transform into a <strong>polymorphic
platform</strong>. We&#39;ll have it fully customizable and most of it working via
plugins. We may end up having—similar to Linux-distributions—specializations
of it, particularly well fitted for a specific task. E.g. <strong>Metapolator</strong>,
which is now <q>custom made</q>, should be built on this platform.</p>

<p>A core feature will always be having the setup for experimentation and exploration,
without the need for polished UI and UX, to allow fast paced development.</p>

<h3>Font-Authoring</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll have a <strong>drawing tool</strong>, that&#39;ll allow drawing fonts with our object model
from scratch. It will be a comfortable tool to work with for type designers.
This will lead to a <strong>fully non-destructive workflow.</strong> I.e. when a master is
changed, the changes will <em>ripple through the instances</em> that inherit from
that master. Fixes for problematic parts after interpolation will <em>persist</em>
and interpolation will happen <em>continuously</em>.</p>

<p>The Metapolator-Object-Model (MOM) and Cascading-Properties-Sheets (CPS)
will be used as the common base. We&#39;ll have different general directions
to explore parametric type design.</p>

<ul>
<li>One general approach is having <strong>generic elements</strong>, like our <code>&lt;penstroke&gt;</code>
or other generic drawing abstractions and making these work in the parametric font.
A great deal for this will be the implementation of a concept with the working
title <strong><q>meta-components</q></strong>, which will make a reuse straight forward. E.g. a serif,
that is made from a generic <code>&lt;contour&gt;</code> element and enhanced with custom
<code>CPS</code>-formulae can be shared across different glyphs and may still get assigned
specific overrides for each instance.</li>
<li>Another general approach is using <strong>specialized elements</strong> that can be loaded
as plugins. E.g. one element-type that draws only serifs, one element-type
that draws only shoulders and so on.</li>
<li>The third approach will be <strong>combining all other directions</strong>. The way CPS
works allows us to mix and match any elements in the object model and make them
work together.</li>
<li>We are <strong>open for more new ideas</strong> on our journey.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New Domains</h3>

<p>It&#39;s easy to come up with <em>custom Object-Models</em> based on our Object-Model-API (OMA)
this entails having the fully functional CPS engine available. All the generic
tools that are not specific for the MOM will be available: <em>loading/saving</em>,
<em>history management</em> and the <em>Developer-Tool</em> platform with all the <em>CPS-Tools</em>
come for free.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll work on inspiring and supporting other people to <em>approach new domains</em>
using our tooling. The <a href="https://github.com/graphicore/Bauhaus-Emblem-Font">Bauhaus-Emblem-Font</a>
is an example and it should be possible to take it further into a parametric <strong>illustration
tool</strong>.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been talking to the <a href="http://valentina-project.org/">Valentina Project</a>
an <em>Open Source (fashion-)pattern drafting software</em>. It would be a blast to
come up with a <strong>pattern drafting software</strong> based on the OMA, i.e. packed with
<code>&lt;collar&gt;</code> elements and so on.</p>

<p>Conceptually, there&#39;s nothing in Atem technology limiting it to be used for
<strong>non-graphical</strong> applications like <strong>audio</strong> or adding a dimension and
exploring <strong>3d modeling</strong>. But, we will have to improve our Property-Language
to be up to the task.</p>

<h2>How we get there</h2>

<p>From here, start to explore the <a href="../Sub-Projects/index.html">Project</a>
and see what we make out of our plan, or consider <a href="../../support-us.md.html">supporting us</a> and
<a href="../../collaborate.md.html">collaboration</a> if you want this
vision to come true.</p>
