<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>I hope I can use parts of Metapolator, especially CPS, to teach people how to make exciting new tools for font and graphic design.</p>

<p>Taking modules out of Metapolator to create stand-alone projects has primarily didactical reasons. It will be easier to show and explain the technology of Metapolator by looking at one part at a the time, instead of everything at once. It will also be easier to write specific documentation for these projects without having to consider the highly specialized nature of Metapolator. Lastly and most exciting for me: we will be able to create cool little projects with our technology to attract, inspire and teach the community. These projects will form an ecosystem around Metapolator: The developer tool for CPS that I&#39;m working on right now will be available for all CPS based projects as an ad-hoc interface.</p>

<p>In the long run we will establish Metapolator technology as a platform to build the next generation of type design tools, or any other domain as well. Metapolator will be positioned as a highly sophisticated application that spawned new core technologies and on the way stimulates and enables new tools.</p>

<p>I want to see more people participating in Metapolator technology in the future; particularly because we offer interesting and genuinely new approaches for parametric design applications, and can enable everything between professional type design/engineering tools to ultra creative graphic design tools that are fun both to make and to use.</p>

<p>For a FLOSS project like ours it is crucial to gain a diverse community. Each part of the project will profit from discussing and solving issues raised by users from any background. We have topics ranging from computer language design to user interaction. The more people use our tools the more ideas and feedback will be available to further advance our mission.</p>

<h2>Coming up next</h2>

<p>Metapolator’s minimal viable product and the CPS Developer Tool are being developed in parallel at the moment. When I have finished the developer tool I will start to decouple some modules, namely: CPS plus the object model basics, MOM (maybe), our IO modules, the pen APIs and a collection of pens, and the CPS Developer Tool itself. I am also planning a series of blog posts to document the workings of these modules on a fairly high level and finally one about Metapolator that builds upon that knowledge. These articles will become part of the Metapolator documentation as well. I also have ideas for up to three fun projects that will prove the claims I made above and attract new people to this ecosystem; I expect one of these will be created soon after the isolation of CPS.</p>
