    <summary type="text">Atem-Project now has a homepage. It's a wiki-like system build around GitHub and made to represent and steer the project.
</summary>
    <content type="html"><p>This is an interesting anouncement for me, though, all the information is
on the site itself: <a href="http://atem.graphicore.de">http://atem.graphicore.de</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a short round up of how we do it and what it is supposed to be:</p>

<h2>Tech</h2>

<p>I made a simple static website generator, details here:
<a href="https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Webgenerator">Atem-Webgenerator</a>.</p>

<p>It will be used from <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to continuously
update this website whenever anyone pushes to the <code>master</code> branch of
(Atem-Project)[<a href="https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project">https://github.com/graphicore/Atem-Project</a>]. This leaves us
with a nice wiki-like system, that is controlled in the way all the other
projects we are working on, via Pull-Request and reviews and so forth.
We got accustomed to that way of working.</p>

<p>We used the Wiki provided by GitHub  previously, but I was unhappy with
the way it (not) counts contributions and with the limited means to
present the contents. With this approach we can have a dignified home.</p>

<h2>What is it good for?</h2>

<p>There are actually two aims.</p>

<ul>
<li>First: the website is a haven for everyone who happens to land here.
It explains what we do, why we do it and how we can be <a href="../support-us.md.html">supported</a>
in doing so.</li>
<li>Second: the website is a core planning and documentation device for Atem,
to actually get work done—like planning, communication and delegation—and
provide up to date information about the project status.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this is described in more detail on the site itself. What&#39;s left to say is a triple <strong>hip hip hooray³</strong>.</p>
