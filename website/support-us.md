# Support Atem

Atem is a project that is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html).

> “Free software” means software that *respects users' freedom and community.*
Roughly, it means that the users have **the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.**
Thus, “free software” is *a matter of liberty, not price*. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” **as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”**.
We sometimes call it “libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis.

This means that you are free to collaborate with us on the project directly. 

Have a look at the [Collaborate]({{ url_for('__root__', filename="collaborate.md") }}) page for details of *"hands-on"* ways to support the project. 

If you read this far, you could do us a great favor by just taking 2 minutes right now to tweet or post on facebook about the project, or email a link out to 2 friends of yours that you think might also be interested.

## Buy a Project Subscription

Respecting your freedom and community also means funding our work is not as straight forward as selling restrictive licenses.

If you like [what we do]({{url_for('content/Vision:index')}}) and want us to keep doing it, then please **become a Patron.**

Its easy to support the project with a monthly subscription via [Patreon.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon)

> Patreon is a *crowd-funding platform* popular with YouTube content creators,
musicians, and webcomic artists. It allows artists to *obtain funding from
their fans or patrons*, on a **recurring basis**, or **per work of art**.

Patrons will get special access to Atem online and live events, and influence the project schedule and roadmap. 

Currently the subscription funds [Lasse](http://graphicore.de/en/page/lasse) directly.

## Software Development Services

If you use Atem at work, or are considering it, please contact [Lasse](http://graphicore.de/en/page/lasse) directly.

Using his services will surely make your product better, and can begin with a short video-call consultation. 
Lasse is currently available for long-term development contracts beginning in November 2016.

If your project requires more time than one person can provide, Lasse can draw on a network of other developers familiar with the technology who can join your project and hit the ground running.
